A partial source release is included with the game in the Source folder.
Here you'll find a few of the source files for the base game for your reference.
You can also decompile the whole game using a .NET decompiler like dotPeek or ILSpy.


Some basic legal clarification:
	-You're welcome to make whatever mod you like and distribute it as broadly as possible.
	-You may only distribute RimWorld mods non-commercially (for free).
	-You may accept donations, but only if all your mods are free for everyone.

Cheers
